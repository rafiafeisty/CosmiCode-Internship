      <h3>History Of Computer</h3>
      <p>
        One of the earliest and most well-known devices was an abacus. Then in
        1822, the father of computers, Charles Babbage began developing what
        would be the first mechanical computer. And then in 1833 he actually
        designed an Analytical Engine which was a general-purpose computer.

        After this every year innovations were made and this process is still
        going on, bringing revolution to the technology after every passing year

      <h3>Details About the Components</h3>
      <h4>Central Processing Unit(CPU) <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/Intel_i9-14900KF_CPU.jpg" alt="CPU" width="50"></h4>
      <p>
        The CPU, or Central Processing Unit, is the "brain" of a computer,
        responsible for executing instructions and performing calculations. It's
        the primary component that processes data, manages other hardware
        components, and runs software. Essentially, it's the core component that
        enables a computer to perform any task.
      </p>
      <h4>Motherboard <img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/64/170564-050-7A0A86A2/motherboard-for-computer.jpg" alt="Motherboard" width="50"></h4>
      <p>
        A motherboard is the central circuit board in a computer that connects
        all other components, acting as a backbone for communication and power
        distribution. It provides the foundation for the CPU, memory, storage,
        and other peripherals to work together.
      </p>
      <h4>Random Access Memory (RAM) <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSuyEGP5hTNDghng0zgDmYmCcRonucurcwpaQ&s" alt="RAM" width="50"> </h4>
      <p>
        Random Access Memory (RAM) is the short-term, high-speed memory in a
        computer that stores data and instructions currently being used by the
        CPU. It's volatile, meaning data is lost when the computer is turned
        off. RAM is crucial for fast and efficient processing, as it allows the
        CPU to quickly access information needed for running applications and
        programs.
      </p>
      <h4>Hard Disk Drive (HDD) <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQhgsR4uOWeMZKapeMrMVM_HlKMkzLI-G_cjw&s" alt="HDD" width="50"></h4>
      <p>
        A Hard Disk Drive (HDD) is a data storage device that uses magnetic
        platters to store and retrieve digital information. It's a non-volatile
        storage medium, meaning it retains data even when powered off. HDDs are
        commonly used as the primary or secondary storage in computers, offering
        large storage capacities at a relatively low cost per gigabyte compared
        to other storage technologies like SSDs.
      </p>
      <h4>Solid State Drive (SSD) <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRzjkhbiw8eWopn5opUfaICfSiVWO6Ba29Vkg&s" alt="SSD" width="50"></h4>
      <p>
        A Solid State Drive (SSD) is a storage device that uses flash memory to
        store data, unlike traditional Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) which use
        spinning disks and mechanical read/write heads. SSDs are known for their
        speed, reliability, and efficiency, offering faster data access, boot
        times, and overall system responsiveness. They are also more durable,
        less prone to damage from drops or shocks, and consume less power.
      </p>
      <h4>Power Supply Unit (PSU) <img src="https://www.minitool.com/images/uploads/lib/2020/08/power-supply-unit/power-supply-unit-1.jpg" alt="PSU" width="50"> </h4>
      <p>
        A Power Supply Unit (PSU) is a hardware component that converts AC
        (Alternating Current) electricity from a wall outlet into stable,
        low-voltage DC (Direct Current) power that computer components need. It
        acts as the heart of the computer, providing the necessary power to all
        internal parts, and is crucial for system stability and performance.
      </p>
      <h4>Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) <img src="https://www.techtarget.com/rms/onlineImages/virtual_desktop-amd_ati_mobile.jpg" alt="GPU" width="50"></h4>
      <p>
        A Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) is a specialized electronic circuit
        designed to rapidly manipulate and alter memory to accelerate the
        creation of images in a frame buffer intended for output to a display.
        GPUs are crucial for handling graphics-intensive tasks such as rendering
        3D images, video editing, and gaming. They are also increasingly used in
        high-performance computing (HPC), deep learning, and other
        computationally intensive applications due to their parallel processing
        capabilities.
      </p>
      <h4>Optical Drive (CD/DVD) <img src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/pcw12_Hitachi_ODD.jpg?quality=50&strip=all&w=1200" alt="Optical Drive" width="50"></h4>
      <p>
        An optical drive (also known as an optical disc drive or ODD) is a
        storage device that uses a laser to read and potentially write data to
        optical discs like CDs, DVDs, and Blu-ray discs. These drives are
        commonly found in computers and allow users to play music, watch movies,
        install software from discs, and create backups.
      </p>
      <h4>Cooling System (Fans or Liquid Cooling) <img src="https://www.ekwb.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2.-Air-Cooling-vs-Liquid-Cooling-liquid-cooler-comprised-of-a-water-block-a-pump-tubing-and-a-radiator-with-fans.jpg" alt="Cooling System" width="50"></h4>
      <p>
        Both air cooling (using fans and heatsinks) and liquid cooling (using a
        liquid coolant to transfer heat to a radiator) are methods for managing
        the temperature of computer components. Liquid cooling is generally more
        efficient and quieter, especially for high-performance systems, but it
        can also be more expensive and complex to install and maintain.
      </p>
      <h4>Sound Card <img src="https://www.ion.com.pk/wp-content/uploads/REMALL-V8-Audio-Interface-a.jpg" alt="Sound Card" width="50"></h4>
      <p>
        A sound card, also known as an audio card, is a computer component that
        enables the input and output of audio signals. It acts as an
        intermediary between the computer's digital system and the analog world
        of sound, converting digital data into analog signals for speakers and
        headphones, and vice versa for microphones.
